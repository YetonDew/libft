# Libft

Your very first own C library ðŸš€  

## ðŸ“Œ Summary
The **Libft** project consists of coding a custom C library that implements a set of
general-purpose functions.  
These functions will be very useful for future projects at **42** and will help you
understand how standard C libraries are built under the hood.
